Buster (the Website)
====================

This is a toy application I made for a job interview.  It builds
on another app (written for the same purpose) called Buster, which
captured, parsed and stored a bunch of transportation data from the
Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) and a number of sources of
demographic data.  This website demonstrates some nifty aspects of
SQLAlchemy, like the eager loading of the objects related to the core
BusStop model object, and some OpenLayers vector layer work in the
template.

You can see what it looks like deployed to heroku here_.
